# Turbo Projects

Some projects made by me (Joshua Lawton), as some example work and other projects that I want to do.

## Current Projects

At the moment, there are no completed projects, but that (hopefully) won't last long.

## Included:

There are currently 2 apps, a home app and a 'base' app. The base app will be copied and replicated for more larger projects, while the home app is currently the catch-all, and will be the primary landing page.

## Setup

As normal, run the following (using pnpm, or another package manager):

```
pnpm i
```

## Building and Developing

To build, within the turbo-projects directory, run the command:

```
turbo build
```

(Requires Turbo)

Alternatively, to develop, within the turbo-projects directory, run the command:

```
turbo dev
```
